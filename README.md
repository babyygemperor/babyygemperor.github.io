### [does-hkh-have-internet](https://github.com/babyygemperor/babyygemperor.github.io/blob/main/does-hkh-have-internet/index.html)

This webpage attempts to load a payload from my home server through a telebit-tunnel.\
When the payload is successfully loaded,
it displays "Yes" respectively to show that HKH does indeed have internet,
however if it fails to load the payload, it assumes that HKH does not have internet. \
It also means, that if my home server is down for maintenance, it'll be assumed that HKH does not have internet.
